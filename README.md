Riviera OS is an open-source operating system project based on Debian/Ubuntu, designed to be user friendly for all technical abilities. I hope it can encourage more users to make the switch from Windows/MacOS to Linux, or at the very least try it out. I will combine my favourite parts from other distros into this and I strongly encourage suggestions and collobaration on this project.
